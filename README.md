# Casper

Casper is a transparent proxy designed to be used during a web application
penetration test during a manual target link discovery step.

Instead of just fireup a crawler, with casper you can have the link visited
during a normal user session.

This is ideal to understand the logic sequence steps and what's happening
behind the woods.
